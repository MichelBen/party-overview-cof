**ONLY WITH FVTT V9 and COF SYSTEM**


# Party Overview

This is a **temporary** copy of mclemente's party-overview module to support "Chroniques Oubli√©es Fantasy" (COF) system, it's a fan system..

This system will not be migrated to Fvtt V10 because it will be rewrited by it's editor BalckBookEdition (we don't have a release date).

To be able to add this system, I retreive mclemente's party-overview module from V2.14, the last release running with FVTT V9. (https://github.com/mclemente/party-overview)

A quick overview about the players that have tokens placed on the currently active scene. 

Using filters, you can hide and show players to your hearts desire, to quickly get the information you need in the heat of the battle.

### Caveats and additional information

- Only tokens that are owned by players will appear in the list: Assign those permissions by right-clicking on the Actor in the sidebar, then select "Permissions" and set "Owner"-role to one of the configured players.
- When switching scenes, the list will automatically update to show only the currently active players.
